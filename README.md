# Employee-Burnout-Analysis-and-Prediction
The problem statement for this project is   
    As it is increasingly important to recognize and address the signs of burnout in order to maintain the health and well-being of employees.
    we will be exploring the use of regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing a dataset containing various factors that
    may contribute to burnout such as workload, mental fatigue job and work-life balance and  develop a model to identify individuals who may
    be at risk of burnout. By proactively addressing these risk factors, organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of
    their employees.
->first Employee burnout is a significant issue affecting productivity, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. With the growing awareness of 
mental health in the workplace, predicting and preventing burnout has become a priority for many organizations. This project aims to develop a
system for predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. The following sections provide an overview of the project's features,
technologies used, and instructions for setting up and running the project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The key features of the project are
A) Data Collection: The relevant dataset is collected from the Kaggle 
website which contains information about factors like Employee ID, Date 
of joining, Gender, Company, WFH setup availability, Designation, 
Resource allocation, Number of working hours, Mental Fatigue Score, Burn 
rate. 
B) Data Preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned like finding the null 
and missing values in the data set filling it with respective values and 
identifying the repeated values in the data set and removing them and 
maintaining the consistency.  
C) Feature Selection: Key features contributing to employee burnout were 
identified through correlation analysis and domain knowledge. 
D) Model Training: A linear regression model was trained on the 
preprocessed data using selected features. 
E) Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using 
metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score to ensure its 
accuracy and reliability. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:The analysis of the model's predictions revealed employees 
with high workloads, low job satisfaction, and poor work-life balance were more likely to 
experience burnout. The strong R-squared score indicates that the linear regression model 
is effective in capturing the relationships between these factors and burnout. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Conclusion/Recommendation: 
The project developed an accurate linear regression model for predicting employee burnout, 
emphasizing the significance of monitoring workload, job satisfaction, and work-life balance to prevent 
burnout. Recommendations include conducting regular employee surveys, utilizing predictive models to 
identify at-risk employees, and implementing proactive measures such as workload management, 
improving job satisfaction, and supporting work-life balance to mitigate burnout effectively. 
By adopting these recommendations, organizations can improve employee well-being, reduce turnover 
rates, and enhance overall productivity.
